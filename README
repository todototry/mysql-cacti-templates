INTRODUCTION
============

This is a set of templates for monitoring MySQL servers and other resources with
Cacti.  It is also a compact, maintainable set of template definitions and a set
of tools for generating templates from these definitions.  The project is hosted
at http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/.

Commercial support and enhancements are available through Percona, where the
developer works.  Their website is http://www.percona.com

Thanks are due to The Rimm-Kaufman Group, who sponsored part of the template
development.  The Rimm-Kaufman Group is a search engine advertising agency that
helps its clients place ads on Google, Yahoo, and other major search engines.
